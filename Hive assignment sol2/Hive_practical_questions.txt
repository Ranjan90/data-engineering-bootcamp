Hive Practical questions:

Hive Join operations

Create a  table named CUSTOMERS(ID | NAME | AGE | ADDRESS   | SALARY)
ans  --
create table customers
(
id int,
name string,
age int,
address string,
salary int
)
row format delimited
feilds terminated by ',';

Create a Second  table ORDER(OID | DATE | CUSTOMER_ID | AMOUNT
ans --
create table orders
(
oid int,
date string,
customer_id int,
amt int
)
row format delimited
feilds terminated by ',';

Now perform different joins operations on top of these tables
(Inner JOIN, LEFT OUTER JOIN ,RIGHT OUTER JOIN ,FULL OUTER JOIN)

# inner join
select * from customer c
inner join orders o
on c.id = o.customer_id

# left join
select * from customer c
left join orders o
on c.id = o.customer_id

# right join
select * from customer c
right join orders o
on c.id = o.customer_id

# full outer join
select * from customer c
full outer join orders o
on c.id = o.customer_id



BUILD A DATA PIPELINE WITH HIVE

Download a data from the given location - 
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00360/

1. Create a hive table as per given schema in your dataset 
ans --
create table AirQue
(
date_d string,
time string,
CO_GT float,
PT08_S1_CO int,
NMHC_GT int,
C6H6_GT float,
PT08_S2_NMHC int,
NOx_GT int,
PT08_S3_NOx int,
NO2_GT int,
PT08_S4_NO2 int,
PT08_S5_O3 int,
T float,
RH float,
AH float
)
row format delimited
fields terminated by ','
tblproperties("skip.header.line.count"="1");

2. try to place a data into table location
ans -- 
load data inpath '/data_files/AirQualityUCI_Copy.csv' into table AirQue;

3. Perform a select operation.
ans --
select * from AirQue limit 5;
 
4. Fetch the result of the select operation in your local as a csv file.
ans --
created a airque_to_csv.hql and content of this file as below.
use hive_assign_2;
select * from AirQue;

and then ran a command on hive container
hive -f airque_to_csv.hql >> airque_to_csv.csv

 
5. Perform group by operation.
ans -- 
To perform group by operation. I did use aggregate funtion sum.
select date_d,
sum(CO_GT), sum(PT08_S1_CO), sum(NMHC_GT), sum(C6H6_GT),
sum(PT08_S2_NMHC), sum(NOx_GT), sum(PT08_S3_NOx), sum(NO2_GT),
sum(PT08_S4_NO2), sum(PT08_S5_O3), sum(T), sum(RH), sum(AH) from AirQue
group by date_d
 
6. Perform filter operation at least 5 kinds of filter examples.
first filter operation--
select * from AirQue where date_d = '10-03-2004';

second filter operation --
select * from AirQue where date_d = '10-03-2004' and time > '20:00:00';

third filter operation --
select * from AirQue where date_d = '10-03-2004' limit 3;

forth filter operation --
select * from AirQue where date_d in ('10-03-2004', '11-03-2004');

fifth filter operation --
select date_d,count(CO_GT) from AirQue where date_d = '11-03-2004' group by date_d;

 
7. show and example of regex operation
ans --
select distinct(date_d) from AirQue where date_d regexp '^01';

8. alter table operation
ans --
added a column 'myname' with string as datatype
alter table AirQue add columns (myname string);

deleted column 'myname'
we can not just drop a column in hive with the command - alter table table_name drop column_name;
So I used 'replace'

 alter table AirQue replace columns (date_d string,
 time string,
 CO_GT float,
 PT08_S1_CO int,
 NMHC_GT int,
 C6H6_GT float,
 PT08_S2_NMHC int,
 NOx_GT int,
 PT08_S3_NOx int,
 NO2_GT int,
 PT08_S4_NO2 int,
 PT08_S5_O3 int,
 T float,
 RH float,
 AH float);
 
9 . drop table operation
ans --
drop table airque;

10 . order by operation.
ans -- Below is the example of count of negative numbers in all numeric columns from AirQue table and ordered by the count as asc

select 'CO_GT' as word, count(CO_GT) as count from AirQue where CO_GT < 0
union
select 'PT08_S1_CO' as word, count(PT08_S1_CO) as count from AirQue where PT08_S1_CO < 0
union
select 'NMHC_GT' as word, count(NMHC_GT) as count from AirQue where NMHC_GT < 0
union
select 'C6H6_GT' as word, count(C6H6_GT) as count from AirQue where C6H6_GT < 0
union
select 'PT08_S2_NMHC' as word, count(PT08_S2_NMHC) as count from AirQue where PT08_S2_NMHC < 0
union
select 'NOx_GT' as word, count(NOx_GT) as count from AirQue where NOx_GT < 0
union
select 'PT08_S3_NOx' as word, count(PT08_S3_NOx) as count from AirQue where PT08_S3_NOx < 0
union
select 'NO2_GT' as word, count(NO2_GT) as count from AirQue where NO2_GT < 0
union
select 'PT08_S4_NO2' as word, count(PT08_S4_NO2) as count from AirQue where PT08_S4_NO2 < 0
union
select 'PT08_S5_O3' as word, count(PT08_S5_O3) as count from AirQue where PT08_S5_O3 < 0
union
select 'T' as word, count(T) as count from AirQue where T < 0
union
select 'RH' as word, count(RH) as count from AirQue where RH < 0
union
select 'AH' as word, count(AH) as count from AirQue where AH < 0
order by count
 

11 . where clause operations you have to perform.
ans -- 
select * from AirQue where date_d in ('10-03-2004', '11-03-2004');


12 . sorting operation you have to perform.
ans --
select pt08_s1_co from AirQue where date_d = '10-03-2004' sort by pt08_s1_co;


13 . distinct operation you have to perform. 
ans --
select distinct(date_d) from AirQue limit 5;


14 . like an operation you have to perform.
ans --
select * from AirQue where date_d like '01-01%';


15 . union operation you have to perform.
ans -- below is an example of count of negative number in columns CO_GT and PT08_S1_CO from table AirQue.
select 'CO_GT' as word, count(CO_GT) as count from AirQue where CO_GT < 0
union
select 'PT08_S1_CO' as word, count(PT08_S1_CO) as count from AirQue where PT08_S1_CO < 0


16. table view operation you have to perform. 
ans -- below is an example of view for distinct date values
create view unique_dates as
select distinct date_d from AirQue;
