## Assignment Part-1
Q1. Why do we call Python as a general purpose and high-level programming language?
sol:- Python is a general-purpose language, meaning it can be used to solve a variety of different programs for and it isn't 
 specialized for any specific problems.we can use Python to solve problems for common scenarios.It is called as high level programming
 language as it can be easily understood by Humans.


Q2. Why is Python called a dynamically typed language?
sol:-In other programming languaged like C++,Java etc there is a there is a strict declaration of variables before assigning values to them.
but in python you dont need to declare the type of variable hence it is dynamically typed language.

Q3. List some pros and cons of Python programming language?
sol: The pros of pythons are
1)Beginner-friendly
2)Large Community
3)Flexible and Extensible
4)Extensive Libraries
5)Embeddable
6)Highly Scalable
7) It is widley use in machine learning 
8)portable

The cons are
1) It is a dynamically typed language
2)Python is unsuitable for complicated designs.
3)It is not as fast as other standard compiled languages.
4)Fails to offer 100% security.
5)Python suffers from high memory consumption.



Q4. In what all domains can we use Python?
sol: 1)Python is the go-to programming language for data science domain such as artificial intelligence, machine learning and deep learning
2)it is used for web development
3)it is used in Gaming
4) It is used in OS development

Q5. What are variable and how can we declare them?
sol:-A Python variable is a reserved memory location to store values. In other words, 
a variable in a python program gives data to the computer for processing.
ex:- a=10,b='test' 

Q6. How can we take an input from the user in Python?
sol:- using Input() function in python
ex:-a= input()

Q7. What is the default datatype of the value that has been taken as an input using input() function?
sol:- String type

Q8. What is type casting?
sol:- Coverting a variable from one data type to another is called as type casting.
ex:-a = 5
 # typecast to float
n = float(a)

Q9. Can we take more than one input from the user using single input() function? If yes, how? If no, why?
sol: yes we can take more than one input using SPlit method
x,y,z = input("Enter variables: ").split(",",3)
print(x,y,z)

Q10. What are keywords?
sol: Keywords are reserved words that cannot be used as variable names, function names, or any other identifiers:

Q11. Can we use keywords as a variable? Support your answer with reason.
No we cannot use keywords as variable or function names or any identifier as per python official documentation it will throw error
ex:- def=[45,5665,98] will throw an error



Q12. What is indentation? What's the use of indentaion in Python?

sol: indentation is giving correct spaces and tabs in the code which makes it easily readable and understandable.As per the guide lines of Python without indentation 
it will definitly through you the error.
ex:if a>200:{ print("inueron") } else: print("Inueron") 

Q13. How can we throw some output in Python?
sol:using print() function
ex:-print("hello ")

Q14. What are operators in Python?
sol: operators are special symbols that designate that some sort of computation should be performed
ex:- x+y,a-b,c*d 

Q15. What is difference between / and // operators?
sol:- '/' is the division operator. '//' is the floor division operator. 
ex:-10/3 returns 3.33 while 10//3 gives 3

Q16. Write a code that gives following as an output.
```
iNeuroniNeuroniNeuroniNeuron
```
sol: c="iNeuron"
print(c*4)

Q17. Write a code to take a number as an input from the user and check if the number is odd or even.
sol: n=int(input(""))
if n%2==0:
    print("It is even")
else:
    print("It is odd")

Q18. What are boolean operator?
sol:The logical operators and, or and not are also referred to as boolean operators. While and as well as or operator needs 
two operands, which may evaluate to true or false, not operator needs one operand evaluating to true or false.
Boolean and operator returns true if both operands return true.

Q19. What will the output of the following?
```
1 or 0
sol:1

0 and 0
sol:0

True and False and True
sol: False

1 or 0 or 0
sol:1
```

Q20. What are conditional statements in Python?
sol: A conditional statement as the name suggests itself, is used to handle conditions in your program. 
These statements guide the program while making decisions based on the conditions encountered by the program.

Q21. What is use of 'if', 'elif' and 'else' keywords?
sol: Python uses the if keyword to implement decision control if expression evaluates to true do something
else:- if you want to execute condition other than that in if block then use else keyword.
elif :- if you want to implement multiple if conditions then we need to use elif.

Q22. Write a code to take the age of person as an input and if age >= 18 display "I can vote". If age is < 18 display "I can't vote".
sol:

n=int(input())
if n>=18:
    print("I can vote")
else:
    print("I can't vote")

Q23. Write a code that displays the sum of all the even numbers from the given list.
```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
```
sol:numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
result=0
for i in numbers:
    if(i%2==0):
        result+=i
print(result)


Q24. Write a code to take 3 numbers as an input from the user and display the greatest no as output.
sol: a=int(input())
b=int(input())
c=int(input())

if (a>b) and (a>c):
    print("max number is",a)
elif(b>c) and (b>a):
    print("max number is",b)
else:
    print("max number is ",c)

Q25. Write a program to display only those numbers from a list that satisfy the following conditions

- The number must be divisible by five

- If the number is greater than 150, then skip it and move to the next number

- If the number is greater than 500, then stop the loop
```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
sol: 
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
for i in numbers:
    if(i%5==0):
        if(i>150):
            continue
        if(i>500):
            break
        else:
            print(i)
