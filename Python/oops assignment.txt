Q1. What is the purpose of Python's OOP?
sol:An object-oriented paradigm is to design the program using classes and objects.The oops concept focuses on writing the reusable code. It is a widespread technique to 
solve the problem by creating objects.It makes the development and maintenance easier.It provides data hiding. So it is more secure than procedural languages. You cannot access 
private data from anywhere.

Q2. Where does an inheritance search look for an attribute?
sol: Python searches for an attribute in an upward tree of attributes. Tt first searches for the attribute in its instance and 
then looks in the class it is generated from, to all super classes listed in its class header.

Q3. How do you distinguish between a class object and an instance object?
sol: The differences between a class object and an instance object are:

1.Class is a template for creating objects whereas object is an instance of class

2.Seperate memory is allocated for each object whenever an object is created. but for a class this doesnot happens.

3.A Class is created once. Many objects are created using a class.

4.As Classes have no allocated memory. they can't be manipulated. but objects can be manipulated.

Q4. What makes the first argument in a class’s method function special?
sol: Python Classes usually have three types of methods which are:
Instance Methods (object level methods),Class Methods (class level methods),Static Methods (general utility methods)

self is the first argument for instance methods. which refers to the object itself

cls is the first argument for class methods which refers to the class itself

Q5. What is the purpose of the init method?
sol: init is a reseved method in python classes. It serves the role of a constructor in object oriented terminology. This method is called when an object is created from a class and 
it allows the class to initialize the attributes of the class.

Q6. What is the process for creating a class instance?
sol: To create a class instance, we need to call the class by its name and pass the arguments to the class, which its init method accepts.

Example: my_name = my_class("Ranjan","Anantharam") Here my_name is an instance of class my_class with attributes "Ranjan" and "Anantharam".

Q7. What is the process for creating a class?
sol: class keyword is used to created a class in python. The syntax to create a class in python is class :
Example: class Shape: ➞ this creates a class called Shape

Q8. How would you define the superclasses of a class?
sol: Superclass/Parent class is given as a arugment to the child class
Example: class Employee(Person): Here child class Employee inherits attributes and methods/functions from Superclass/Parent Person

Q9. What is the relationship between classes and modules?
sol Classes are blueprints that allow you to create instances with attributes and bound functionality. Classes support inheritance, metaclasses, 
and descriptors.Whereas, Modules in python is simply a way to organize the code, and it contains either python classes or just functions. If you 
need those classes or functions in your project, you just import them.

Q10. How do you make instances and classes?
sol: To create instances of a class, you call the class using class name and pass in whatever arguments its init method accepts.
ex: "This would create first object of Employee class"
emp1 = Employee("Zara", 2000)
"This would create second object of Employee class"
emp2 = Employee("Manni", 5000)

For creating a class, we use the Class keyword. Class keyword is followed by classname and semicolon.
ex: class Employee:
    def __init__(self, gender,salary):
        self.gender = gender
        self.salary = salary

Q11. Where and how should be class attributes created?
sol: Class attributes or Class level Attributes belong to the class itself. these attributes will be shared by all the 
instances of the class. Hence these attributes are usually created/defined in the top of class definiation outside all methods.
class Car:
    no_of_wheels = 4; # this is a class attribute
    def __init__(self,color,price,engine):
        self.color = color # All this are instance attributes
        self.price = price
        self.engine = engine


Q12. Where and how are instance attributes created?
sol: Instances attributes are passed to the class when an object of the class is created. Unlike class attributes, instance 
attributes are not shared by all objects of the classs. Instead each object maintains its own copy of instance attributes at object level whereas incase of class attributes, all instances of class refer to a single copy. Usually instance attributes are defined within the init method of class.
class Car:
    def __init__(self,color,price,engine):
        self.color = color # All this are instance attributes
        self.price = price
        self.engine = engine

nexon_ev = Car('Indigo Blue', 1400000, 'electric')
safari = Car('Pearl White',2100000, 'petrol')

#nexon_ev, safari are both the instances of class Car with different instance variables.

Q13. What does the term "self" in a Python class mean?
sol: self represents the instance of the class (it represents the object itself). By using the “self” keyword we can access the attributes and methods of the class with in the class in python. 
It binds the attributes with the given arguments.
class Car:
    def __init__(self,color,price,engine):
        self.color = color # All this are instance attributes
        self.price = price
        self.engine = engine

nexon_ev = Car('Indigo Blue', 1400000, 'electric')
safari = Car('Pearl White',2100000, 'petrol')

print(nexon_ev.__dict__)
print(safari.__dict__)
Q14. How does a Python class handle operator overloading?
sol: Python Classes handle operator overloading by using special methods called Magic methods. These special methods usually begin and end with __ (double underscore)
Example: Magic methods for basic arithmetic operators are:

+ -> __add__()

- -> __sub__()

* -> __mul__() 

/ -> __div__()

class Book:
    def __init__(self,pages):
        self.pages = pages
    def __add__(self,other):
        return self.pages + other.pages
b1 = Book(500)
b2 = Book(700)
print(f'The total number of pages in 2 books is {b1+b2}')

Q15. When do you consider allowing operator overloading of your classes?
sol:We consider allowing operator overloading when we want to have different meaning for the same operator. For example operator + is used to add two integers as well as join two strings and merge two lists.
 It is achievable because ‘+’ operator is overloaded by int class and str class.
 # Python program to show use of
# + operator for different purposes.
 
print(1 + 2)
 
# concatenate two strings
print("Ranjan"+"Anantharam")
 
# Product two numbers
print(3 * 4)
 
# Repeat the String
print("Ineuron"*4)

Q16. What is the most popular form of operator overloading?
sol: The most popular form of operator overloading in python is by special methods called Magic methods.
 It usually begins and ends with double underscore 
 ex:class A:
    def __init__(self,a):
        self.a = a
    def __add__(self,o):
        return self.a+o.a
obj1 = A(1)
obj2 = A(2)
obj3 = A('Nancy')
obj4 = A(' Soni')
print(f'Sum -> {obj1+obj2}')
print(f'String Concatenation -> {obj3+obj4}')

Q17. What are the two most important concepts to grasp in order to comprehend Python OOP code?
sol: Classes and objects are the two most important concepts to grasp in order to comprehend python OOP code as 
more formally objects are entities that represent instances of general abstract concept called class.
Along with classes and objects the important concepts to grasp are:
1.Inheritence
2.Abstraction
3.Polymorphism
4.Encapsulation
Q18. Describe three applications for exception processing.
sol:Exception Processing is important to find exceptions that causes the runtime error as runtime errors halt the program execution when exception occurs.
Exception Processing is used in Various Applications. Few examples are:
1.Checking Appropriate use of input in an application
2.Checking for Arithmetic exceptions in mathematical executions
3.Checking File I/O exceptions during File handling

Q19. What happens if you don't do something extra to treat an exception?
sol: If Exceptions are not handled, flow of program will be broken during the run time which might lead to an abnormal 
termination of the program. Inshort inability of program to handle exceptions will result in crashing of program and 
we will not be able to get the desired result.


Q20. What are your options for recovering from an exception in your script?
sol: Python provides try and except statements for recovering from an exception in our script.
try:
  print(x)
except:
  print("An exception occurred") 

Q21. Describe two methods for triggering exceptions in your script.
sol: raise and assert are two methods that can be used to trigger manual exceptions in our script.
1.raise method triggers an exception if condition provided to it turns out to be True.
2.assert will let the program to continue execution if condition provided to it turns out to be True else exception will be raised
# Example of raise
x = 101
raise Exception(f'X Value Should not exceed 5 The Provided Value of X is {x}')

# Example of assert
assert(2==10), "2 is not equal to 4"

Q22. Identify two methods for specifying actions to be executed at termination time, regardless of
whether or not an exception exists.
sol: Python Provides else and finally blocks for specifying actions to be executed at termination time, regardless of whether an exceptions exists or not.


Q23. What is the purpose of the try statement?
sol: try statement is used for exception handling in python. It consists of a block of risky statements which might cause an exception during runtime. If code within try block raises exception, then the exception will be reverted to the corresponding except block when multiple except blocks are present, else it will be reverted to the default except block. In short, try and except in union avoid programs 
from crashing during runtime due to exceptions.
try:
    print(30/0)
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print('Division by Zero is Not Possible')

Q24. What are the two most popular try statement variations?
sol: The Popular try statement variations are:

1.try,except

2.try,except,finally

3.try,except,finally,else

The try block is used to check code for exceptions during runtime. i.e. code inside try block will execute completely when there is no error in the program where as the code inside except block will execute whenever the program encounters some error in the preceeding try block.

Where as the code enters the else block if and only if the try clause does not raise an exception. The code in the finally block will execute irrespective of exception.

Q25. What is the purpose of the raise statement?
sol: raise statement is used to trigger an exception explicitly, if a certain condition is not as per requirement of programmer. raise statement helps in triggering exception as per programming logic.


Q26. What does the assert statement do, and what other statement is it like?
sol:There are few assertions that programmer always want to be true to avoid code failure. This type of requirement is fulfilled by assert statement. This statement takes a boolean condition output of which is True which in turn helps Further Program Execute. 
If output of assert statement is False, it raises an Assertion Error.
ex: assert(2 == 10), f'this is not a valid statement'

Q27. What is the purpose of the with/as argument, and what other statement is it like?
sol: with/as statement simplifies use of file handling in python. When we use a with statement for file reading, there is no need for programmer to explicitly take care of activities like resource deallocation and file closing by using file.close() method. with statement itself ensures proper acquisition and release of resources. This avoids triggering of exceptions if the file closing is unknowingly forgotten in the code execution.
with open('sample_file.txt','w') as file:
file.write('Hello World')

Q28. What are *args, **kwargs?
sol: In Python, we can pass a variable number of arguments to a function using special symbols. There are two special symbols:
*args (Non Keyword Arguments): Python has *args which allow us to pass the variable number of non keyword arguments to function.
ex:def adder(*num):
    sum = 0
    
    for n in num:
        sum = sum + n

    print("Sum:",sum)

adder(3,5)
adder(4,5,6,7)
adder(1,2,3,5,6)
**kwargs (Keyword Arguments): it allows us to pass the variable length of keyword arguments to the function.
ex:def intro(**data):
    print("\nData type of argument:",type(data))

    for key, value in data.items():
        print("{} is {}".format(key,value))

intro(Firstname="Sita", Lastname="Sharma", Age=22, Phone=1234567890)
intro(Firstname="John", Lastname="Wood", Email="johnwood@nomail.com", Country="Wakanda", Age=25, Phone=9876543210)


Q29. How can I pass optional or keyword parameters from one function to another?

Q30. What are Lambda Functions?

Q31. Explain Inheritance in Python with an example?

Q32. Suppose class C inherits from classes A and B as class C(A,B).Classes A and B both have their own versions of method func(). If we call func() from an object of class C, which version gets invoked?

Q33. Which methods/functions do we use to determine the type of instance and inheritance?

Q34.Explain the use of the 'nonlocal' keyword in Python.

Q35. What is the global keyword?
